VotingAlerter is a browser based tool that allows multiple users to vote on a certain issue/subject anonymously. There is a low or a high threshold and if it is reached, everyone will be notified that it has been reached so that someone can take action.

(Built using expressjs).

Sample Usage:
In a classroom/training program, it is hard to figure out what is the good pace to teach the materials. Students can use this tool to anonymously vote if the class is going too slow or too fast. Once enough students think either way (threshold is hit), everyone, including the instructor, will be alerted. The instructor can adjust his/her lesson accordingly.
